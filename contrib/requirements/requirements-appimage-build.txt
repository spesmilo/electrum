# Note: hidapi requires Cython at build-time (not needed at runtime).
# For reproducible builds, the version of Cython must be pinned down.
# The pinned Cython must be installed before hidapi is built;
# otherwise when installing hidapi, pip just downloads the latest Cython.
# see https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/5859
Cython>=0.27
