    </p>
    <h3>
        ABOUT THE APPLICATIONS AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Application is software that generates Wallet addresses that you may use to send and receive Bitcoin Vault
        (“BTCV”) tokens (the “BTCV tokens”).
        You must keep your Wallet address, seed phrase, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may
        result in the loss of control of BTCV tokens associated with the Wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Applications cannot assist with password retrieval. The Applications stores your Wallet address but does not
        receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or seed phrase associated
        with your Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new
        password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet,
        you accept and acknowledge that any BTCV tokens you have associated with such a Wallet address will become
        inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password.
    </p>
    <p>
        You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Products is accurate and complete. You accept
        and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any
        BTCV tokens transaction initiated via the Products. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details
        carefully before attempting to transfer a BTCV tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you start using the Application you must either import or create a Wallet in order to use the Application.
        You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your private key and seed phrase, and will be
        fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password, account, or any other breach of
        security, however we will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this
        respect. When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access
        to and/or control over your Wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before
        initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions due
        to insufficient funds or gas associated with your Wallet account.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted
        transaction details for via the Products, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to
        the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your
        BTCV transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any BTCV
        tokens-related transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        If, to the extent permitted by the Application, you grant express permission to a third party to access or
        connect to your Wallet account, either through the third party’s product or service or through the Application,
        you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not
        relieve you of any of your responsibilities under these Terms. You are fully responsible for all acts or
        omissions of any third party with access to your Wallet account.
    </p>
    You are responsible for:
    <ol type="i">

        you signed these Terms in Poland, without regard to Poland’s conflicts of laws rules. If any provisions of these
        Terms are inconsistent with any applicable law, those provisions will be superseded or modified only to the
        extent such provisions are inconsistent. The parties agree to submit to the courts in Poland for exclusive
        jurisdiction of any dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Products or your breach of these Terms.
        You waive any objection based on lack of personal jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue, or forum non

    <h3>
        TERMINATION
    </h3>
    <p>
        In the event of termination concerning your license to use the Application, your obligations under these Terms
        will still continue. Your access to the funds in your Wallet after termination will depend on your access to
        your backup of your Wallet address and private key.
    </p>
    <h3>
        DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICES
    </h3>
    <p>
        We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to you, with or without prior notice, and at any time, modify or
        discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any portion of our Products. You are solely responsible for storing
        outside of the Products a backup of any Wallet address and private key pair that you maintain in your Wallet.
        Maintaining an external backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs associated with your Wallet will
        allow you to access the Ethereum Networks upon which your Wallet is secured. Such a backup will allow the user
        to fully restore their Wallet at any time without cost or loss of the user’s BTCV tokens. If you do not maintain
        a backup of your Wallet data outside of the Products, you will not be able to access the BTCV tokens associated
        with your Wallet. We shall not be held responsible or liable for any loss of BTCV tokens in the event that we
        discontinue or depreciate the Products.

    <h3>
        NO WAIVER
    </h3>
    <p>
        Our failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms shall not
        operate as a waiver; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege preclude any
        other or further exercise thereof.
    </p>
    <h3>
        WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY
    </h3>
    <p>
        No waiver of the Company of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or
        continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the
        Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms Shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
        provision. If it turns out that any part of these Terms is invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that
        term will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary. The limitation or
        elimination of the term will not affect any other terms.
    </p>
    <h3>
        FORCE MAJEURE
    </h3>
    <p>
        We shall not be held liable for any delays, failure in performance, or interruptions of service which result

        any delay or failure due to any act of God, act of civil or military authorities, act of terrorism, civil
        disturbance, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or Internet services
        or network provider services, failure of equipment and/or software, other catastrophe, or any other occurrence
        which is beyond our reasonable control and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
        provisions.
