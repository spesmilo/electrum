        ## Read this first!

        * This issue tracker is for bug reports and development, not general questions.
        * There is no private support! Scammers will reply to you here and tell you to go to their external website or contact them privately in email/telegram/whatsapp/etc.
          They will try to **steal** your coins!
          Be extremely suspicious of anyone offering help in a non-public way. Scammers will want to chat with you in private as then other people will not get a chance to point out the scam.
        * Do not post issues about non-**Bitcoin** versions of Electrum.
