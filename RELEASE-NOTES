# Release 2.0

 * New address derivation (BIP32).

 * New seed phrase format: 8 bits of the seed phrase are used to store
   a version number. The current version number (0x01) refers to the
   default wallet structure. The version number also serves as a
   checksum for the seed, and it will prevent the import of seeds from
   incompatible wallets.

 * Compact serialization format for unsigned or partially signed
   transactions, that includes the master public key and derivation
   needed to sign inputs. This allows to send partially signed
   transactions using QR codes

 * Deterministic Multisig wallets using parallel BIP32 derivations and
   P2SH addresses (2 of 2, 2 of 3).

 * New plugins: 
   - TrustedCoin: two-factor authentication using 2 of 3 multisig and
     Google Authenticator
   - Trezor: support for the Trezor hardware wallet by SatoshiLabs
   - Cosigner Pool: encrypted communication channel for multisig
     wallets, to send and receive partially signed transactions
   - Audio Modem: send and receive transactions by sound
   - OpenAlias: pay to openalias addresses

 * Support for BIP70: payment requests
   - Verification of the signature chain uses tlslite.
   - In the GUI, payment requests are shown in the 'Invoices' tab.

 * New 'Receive' tab:
   - create and manage payment requests, with QR Codes
   - the former Receive tab was renamed to 'Addresses'
   - the former Point of Sale plugin is replaced by a resizeable
     window that pops up if you click on the QR code

 * The 'Send' tab in the Qt GUI supports transactions with multiple
   outputs, and raw hexadecimal scripts.

 * The GUI can use the daemon: "electrum -d". The daemon can serve
   several clients. It times out if no client uses if for more than 5
   minutes.

 * More watching-only functionality: Create wallets to monitor any 
   address of choice by entering a list of addresses in the install wizard

 * Wallet files are saved as JSON instead of Python.

 * Client supports servers with SSL certificates signed by a CA.

 * Documentation is now hosted on a wiki: http://electrum.orain.org

 * ECIES encrypt/decrypt methods, availabe in the GUI and using the
   command line:
      encrypt <pubkey> <message>
      decrypt <pubkey> <message>



# Release 1.9.8

* Electrum servers were upgraded to version 0.9. The new server stores
  a Patrica tree of all UTXOs, an idea proposed by Alan Reiner in the
  bitcointalk forum. This property allows the client to directly
  request the balance of any address. The new commands are:
     1. getaddressbalance <address> 
     2. getaddressunspent <address>
     3. getutxoaddress <txid> <pos>

* Command-line commands that require a connection to the network spawn
  a daemon, that remains connected and handles subsequent
  commands. The daemon terminates itself if it remains unused for more
  than one minute. The purpose of this is to make scripting more
  efficient. For example, a bash script using many electrum commands
  will open only one connection.

* Classic GUI asks users to enter their seed on wallet creation


# Release 1.7.2:  

* Transactions that are in the same block are displayed in chronological order in the history.
* The client computes transaction priority and rejects zero-fee transactions that need a fee.
* The default fee was lowered to 200 uBTC per kb.
* Due to an internal format change, your history may be pruned when
  you open your wallet for the first time after upgrading to 1.7.2. If
  this is the case, please visit a full server to restore your full
  history. You will only need to do that once.


# Release 1.7.1:  bugfixes.


# Release 1.7

* The Classic GUI can be extended with plugins. Developers who want to
add new features or third-party services to Electrum are invited to
write plugins. Some previously existing and non-essential features of
Electrum (point-of-sale mode, qrcode scanner) were removed from the
core and are now available as plugins.

* The wallet waits for 2 confirmations before creating new
addresses. This makes recovery from seed more robust. Note that it
might create unwanted gaps if you use Electrum 1.7 together with older
versions of Electrum.

* An interactive Python console replaces the 'Wall' tab. The provided
python environment gives users access to the wallet and gui. Most
electrum commands are available as python function in the
console. Custom scripts an be loaded with a "run(filename)"
command. Tab-completions are available.

* The location of the Electrum folder in Windows changed from
LOCALAPPDATA to APPDATA. Discussion on this topic can be found here:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144575.0

* Private keys can be exported from within the classic GUI:
  For a single address, use the address menu (right-click).
  To export the keys of your entire wallet, use the settings dialog (import/export tab).

* It is possible to create, sign and redeem multisig transaction using the 
command line interface.  This is made possible by the following new commands:
    dumpprivkey, listunspent, createmultisig, createrawtransaction, decoderawtransaction, signrawtransaction
The syntax of these commands is similar to their bitcoind counterpart. 
For an example, see Gavin's tutorial: https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/3966071

* Offline wallets now work in a way similar to Armory: 
  1. user creates an unsigned transaction using the online (watching-only) wallet.
  2. unsigned transaction is copied to the offline computer, and signed by the offline wallet.
  3. signed transaction is copied to the online computer, broadcasted by the online client.
  4. All these steps can be done via the command line interface or the classic GUI. 

* Many command line commands have been renamed in order to make the syntax consistent with bitcoind.
