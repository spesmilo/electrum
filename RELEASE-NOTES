# Release 1.7.3:

* Classic GUI can display amounts in mBTC
* Account selector in the classic GUI
* Changed the way the portable flag uses without supplying a -w argument
* Classic GUI asks users to enter their seed on wallet creation


# Release 1.7.2:  

* Transactions that are in the same block are displayed in chronological order in the history.
* The client computes transaction priority and rejects zero-fee transactions that need a fee.
* The default fee was lowered to 200 uBTC per kb.
* Due to an internal format change, your history may be pruned when
  you open your wallet for the first time after upgrading to 1.7.2. If
  this is the case, please visit a full server to restore your full
  history. You will only need to do that once.


# Release 1.7.1:  bugfixes.


# Release 1.7

* The Classic GUI can be extended with plugins. Developers who want to
add new features or third-party services to Electrum are invited to
write plugins. Some previously existing and non-essential features of
Electrum (point-of-sale mode, qrcode scanner) were removed from the
core and are now available as plugins.

* The wallet waits for 2 confirmations before creating new
addresses. This makes recovery from seed more robust. Note that it
might create unwanted gaps if you use Electrum 1.7 together with older
versions of Electrum.

* An interactive Python console replaces the 'Wall' tab. The provided
python environment gives users access to the wallet and gui. Most
electrum commands are available as python function in the
console. Custom scripts an be loaded with a "run(filename)"
command. Tab-completions are available.

* The location of the Electrum folder in Windows changed from
LOCALAPPDATA to APPDATA. Discussion on this topic can be found here:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144575.0

* Private keys can be exported from within the classic GUI:
  For a single address, use the address menu (right-click).
  To export the keys of your entire wallet, use the settings dialog (import/export tab).

* It is possible to create, sign and redeem multisig transaction using the 
command line interface.  This is made possible by the following new commands:
    dumpprivkey, listunspent, createmultisig, createrawtransaction, decoderawtransaction, signrawtransaction
The syntax of these commands is similar to their bitcoind counterpart. 
For an example, see Gavin's tutorial: https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/3966071

* Offline wallets now work in a way similar to Armory: 
  1. user creates an unsigned transaction using the online (watching-only) wallet.
  2. unsigned transaction is copied to the offline computer, and signed by the offline wallet.
  3. signed transaction is copied to the online computer, broadcasted by the online client.
  4. All these steps can be done via the command line interface or the classic GUI. 

* Many command line commands have been renamed in order to make the syntax consistent with bitcoind.
