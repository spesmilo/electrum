Electron Cash is a fork of the open source Electrum Bitcoin wallet (www.electrum.org) for Bitcoin Cash.  The current
release is based on the Electrum 2.9.0 codebase with patches to

- handle Bitcoin Cash difficulty adjustment algorithm
- sign transactions the Bitcoin Cash way
- updated list of electrum servers
- updated icons and branding
- remove RBF (unsupported by Bitcoin Cash network nodes)
- use different directory for wallets and configuration

The Electron Cash software is NOT affiliated, associated, or endorsed by Electrum, electrum.org or the Electrum
developers.

If you are concerned about running Electron Cash binaries we recommend installing and/or running it from the github
source directly.


Usage
-----

When you first run Electron Cash it will use a different configuration directory to Electrum.  On Unix it is
".electron-cash", and on Windows/MacOS it is "ElectronCash".  Your wallet files will be copied from the Electrum
cofiguration directory (".electrum" on unix, "Electrum" on Windows/MacOS), if found.  Initially transactions will show
up as unverified because Electron Cash is downloading the blockchain headers to verify the transactions.  This can take
up to 10 minutes, but is only done once.

Ensure you are running Electron Cash and not Electrum by checking for "Electron Cash" in the title bar wording.  Some
users installing from setup.py have reported conflicts if both Electrum and Electron Cash are installed in parallel
that way.

We STRONGLY recommend you get comfortable and only send a small amount of Bitcoin Cash coins at first, to yourself,
to confirm the network is processing your transactions as expected.

Bitcoin Cash hard forks after the 6th block with timestamp greater than 1 August 2017, 12:20 UTC has been mined.  The
seventh block must be greater than one million bytes in size.

The Bitcoin Cash fork enforces a new signing scheme which is incompatible with the legacy chain.  Electron Cash only
signs transactions using this scheme, so its transactions are only valid on the Bitcoin Cash hard fork after the fork
has occurred.

If you want to send Bitcoin before the fork, or Segwitcoins after the fork, you should continue to use the standard
Electrum client, Electron Cash will not work.

Once the network forks, it will take time for the Electrum server network to split into servers of the Segwit fork, and
servers of the Bitcoin Cash fork.  You should ensure you are connected to a Bitcoin Cash Electrum server in order to
send transactions successfully.  Some servers that will be serving the Bitcoin Cash fork are:

    electrum-abc.cascharia.com via SSL port 50002
    electrum-abc.criptolayer.net via SSL port 50012
    180.235.49.196, 35.185.209.69 and 35.197.25.235  TCP port 50001 and SSL port 50002

There will likely be other servers available; please check their banners in the Console tab (View|Show Console).


Hardware Wallets
----------------

Since Bitcoin Cash enforces a new signing scheme, hardware wallet vendors need to supply new firmware and/or libraries
for the hardware to be able to sign transactions correctly.  Currently such libraries and firmware do not exist, so you
cannot use your hardware wallets with Electron Cash.

To use Electron Cash with your hardware-wallet coins you will need to restore your wallet as a software Electron Cash
BIP44 wallet from its seed so that Electron Cash can sign the transactions itself.  Since this exposes your coins to
risk you may want to wait for the 3rd party software to be developed and integrated instead.


Two-factor Authentication (2FA) Wallets
---------------------------------------

For the same reason as Hardware Wallets above, 2FA wallets need Trustedcoin to perform new Bitcoin Cash-style
signatures for their transactions to be valid on the Bitcoin Cash fork.  If third party support appears we will attempt
to integrate it.


Multisig
--------

For a multisig transaction to be valid on the Bitcoin Cash fork, each signature must be done thew new Bitcoin Cash way,
so each signature must be performed with Electron Cash or other Bitcoin Cash-compatible software.

Unfortunately Electron Cash does not currently work with multisig wallets as Electrum's serialization format for
transferring transactions between cosigners is incomplete.  We intend to fix this.


Miscellaneous
-------------

Electrum 2.9 has new code to deal with chain forks which may have outstanding (pre-existing in Electrum)
bugs and problems.  Since this package forks that code it will contain those issues.

If you have problems syncing to the correct chain fork (take a look at the Overview Tab in the "Network" window (in
Menu "Tools") to see information about chain forks your client knows about), you can try to remove everything except
"wallets" directory and "config" file from your Electron Cash directory.

Electron Cash 3.0 -- This is now on Python 3.  Make sure all python commands are on python 3 and any needed
modules/libraries are imported into pyhon 3.  The build is deterministic for windows (everyone should get
the same binary because of customization to Pyinstaller that was done by Electrum team, as well as separate
repos for locales and icons).  The fee upgrades may not be visible for existing wallet owners
unless you reset the max fee in preferences or remove the config file.  There is no minimum fee on the client
side.  Be careful sending too low of a fee (lower than 1 satoshi/byte) or your transaction may get stuck,
and there is no warning message.

  paremeter is for raw hex to be used as the OP_RETURN payload (0x6a will
  always be prefixed to this raw hex.) (markblundeberg)
* Testnet wallets were using the wrong bip32 key headers. They SHOULD
  accept & generate tpub/tprv on testnet but instead the keys generated were
  xpub/xprv. This was not to spec and has been fixed but, it may mean you will
  need to regenerate your testnet wallets form mnemonic seed. :/ (cculianu)
* Added "Check for updates..." mechanism which is enabled by default
  (check is done once per hour). See Preferences -> General to disable auto
  check. Or Help -> "Check for updates..." for manual checking. (cculianu)
* Added "Dark" theme to UI. See Preferences -> General (cculianu)
* Fixed incompatibility bug where generated QR images were uppercase-only
  BITCOINCASH: which caused problems with some buggy wallet implementations. We
  switched back to generating 'bitcoincash:' (mixed-case) URIs, which is more
  compatible. (cculianu)
* Added "Export contacts" facility to UI so you can export all your contacts to
  a file. (Strangely, we had "Import contacts", but no export!) (cculianu)
* Added "Wallet -> Rebuild history" to Qt GUI. Allows users to re-synch entire
  wallet from server, on demand. (commit: a72b2a72, cculianu)

* Fixed a compatibility issue with Qt 5.12 (SomberNight, cculianu)

# Release 4.0.0

* Privacy features have been added, most notably CashShuffle has been integrated
  strongly into the wallet. It is an optional plugin for shuffling coins
  securely with other users. Coin control and other logic has been added as
  well. The bulk of the work for this release has been this feature.
  (Clifford, cculianu, Josh Ellithorpe, Mark Lundeberg, Jonald Fyookball,
  imaginaryusername, emergent_reasons, acidsploit, and others).
* Fix #1174, #1178 - Resurrection of .onion support (requires enabling of
  non-SSL).
* Fixups for qr code image saving (cculianu), #1175
* Closing a wallet now actually closes its daemon threads. Closing a wallet
  window now also implicitly closes any tx dialog child windows it created.
  Closing the last wallet window in the app will quit the app, even if other
  child windows are still alive. (cculianu)
* Coins tab layout fixups #1180, including right click -> Copy X (cculianu,
  Mark Lundeberg, SomberNight)
* Addition of Wallet -> Scan beyon gap... tool #1194 (cculianu)
* Fixed #968 for the Receive tab -- when the form is unsaved it now always is
  *guaranteed* to refresh itself with a new unused address in real time.
  (cculianu)
* Tx notification systray popup was too intermittent.  It now pops up more
  frequently when reeiving or synching a new wallet. The wording used has also
  been simplified. (cculianu)
* Fix #1182 - Bad proxy can end up in config file (cculianu)
* Fix #1215 - Tabs that are not being shown are no longer refreshed in the GUI.
  They refresh themselves when you switch to them, however, if they need to.
  This should improve perception of UI responsiveness for large wallets
  especially. (cculianu)
* Fixed some bugs related to switching chains (forks) #1185 (cculianu)
* Fixed a bug where importing a private key didn't update the history until
  app restart. (cculianu)
* Fix Network Dialog layout (SomberNight)
* Fix sign message not accept rich text spesmilo#5210 (SomberNight)
* Fix #1189 - Cope better with unknown wallet formats or corrupt wallets on
  startup.  This should improve the experience for SLP users that also use
  regular Electron Cash (cculianu)
* Switch over to bitcoin-abc libsecp in preparation for Schnorr signatures.
  Libsecp is now actually bundled with the Linux "source" tarball. (cculianu)
* Fix to exchange rate prefs screen UI and deletion of BitcoinAverage as a
  historical rate provider (cculianu)
* If running from source, app now has an icon on all platforms (cculianu)
* Fix ubuntu installation for virtual-env (acidsploit)
* Due to phishing being a recurrent annoyance, "Preferred servers only" now
  defaults to "CHECKED" for new installs. (cculianu)
* Many performance improvements, especially for large wallets (cculianu)
* Cache address balance in memory rather than recompute each call (SomberNight)
* Various internal bugfixes (cculianu, SomberNight, ecdsa)

# Release 4.0.1

* Lowest base unit in GUI has been renamed from 'cash' to 'bits' by popular
  demand.  It turns out the 'cash' unit never was popular. (cculianu)
* CashShuffle & Keepkey: Fixed a bug in google protobuf that prevented both
  plugins from being loaded simultaneously. #1227 (cculianu)
* Trezor support has been improved with many bugs fixed. It should be less
  crashy overall when restoring seeds or when cancelling dialogs. (cculianu)
  Special thanks to Technologov for providing feedback and for donating Trezor
  wallets to test & dev on.
* Added ability to load any image to Trezor One or Model T's home screen. The
  image will be scaled and dithered correctly.  You can load PNG, JPG, GIF,
  SVG or whatever other image formats Qt supports. (cculianu)
* CashShuffle: Implemented Coins Tab (right click) -> Reshuffle Coin. Use this
  feature if want to shuffle already-shuffled coins again to keep liquidity up
  or for even more privacy. (cculianu)
* Fix #1235 - Email plugin was broken and crashy. It works now. (cculianu)
* Virtual keyboard plugin looked terrible on some platforms, particularly macOS.
  Its layout has been improved to look good on all plafrotms. (cculianu)
* Windows build is now on Python 3.6.8
* Fix #1238 & #1239 - Dark Mode had some hard to read GUI elements due to poorly
  chosen colors in the Transaction Dialog. Fixed. (cculianu)
* Fix #1231 - Request list esoteric crash when rebuilding history. (cculianu)
* Merge PR #959 - Fix the support for Ledger HW1/Nano legacy hardware w/o
  touching Nano S/Blue (Thomas Preindl, Axel Gembe)
* Ledger: Improved handling of locked Ledger devices (#1245) (Axel Gembe)
* HW Wallets: Fixed devices not being closed properly in some cases (#1246)
  (Axel Gembe)
* HW Wallets: Improved messaging for user when trying to detect a HW device
  and dependent libraries are missing. This affects the install wizard and it
  is hoped it will assist users in troubleshooting. (#1244, #1251) (Axel Gembe)
* HW Wallets: Show proper error message when trying to sign a tx with OP_RETURN
  (#1254) (Axel Gembe)

# Release 4.0.2

* Set the gap limit for change from 6 to 20. This is because we realized
  CashShuffle wallets already behave as if the gap limit were 12 (reserving
  addresses as they shuffle). We just made it official. (Mark Lundeberg)
* Added BIP38 private key support. You can create an import wallet, import
  private keys, or sweep private keys using BIP38.  In either of those 3,
  specify a mix of WIF and/or BIP38 keys and you will be prompted to enter the
  password to decrypt the BIP38 keys in question, 1 at a time. (#1289)
  (cculianu)
* Added Windows CLI support if running from cmd.exe or WindowsPowerShell
  (previously the console output was always mute even if running with -v --
  it only worked for msys, mingw, cygiwn, etc, but not normal Windows console).
  (#1295) (Axel Gembe)
* Windows: Make console no longer flash on startup (#1294) (Axel Gembe)
* Fix to minor esoteric/rare bug in CashShuffle where it may be overzealously
  freezing receiving addresses with non-shuffle outputs on them. (#1291)
  (cculianu)
* Ledger HW Wallet: Remove non-working websocket 2FA for legacy ledger devices
  (#1298) (Axel Gembe)
* Ledger HW Wallet: Added support for OP_RETURN and also multiple transaction
  outputs (on devices that support it). Code mainly taken from Electrum but
  adapted and modified by us. (Axel Gembe)
* Added Linux AppImage builds -- these builds are self-contained binaries with
  everything rolled into a single file.  It should make it much easier for
  Linux users not wishing to install dependencies to simply run Electron Cash.
  Based off Electrum's implementation, with our own customizations. (cculianu)
* OSX: Made the DMG release use a "fancy" dmg with graphics and a symlink to
  /Applications as is customary on macOS. (cculianu)
* Lib: Fixed a potential crash bug if the server sends bad data to the client.
  (cculianu)
* Deprecated support for Python 3.5.  Electron Cash now requires Python 3.6+.
* CLI: Added -x/--disable_preferred_servers command-line option (#1222)
  (cculianu)
* CLI: encrypt/decrypt commands were broken. They are now working. (#1270)
  (cculianu)
* Disabled all fee estimates in the codebase.  They are useless on BCH anyway
  and were a holdover from our BTC roots.  BCH tx's always confirm next block
  if they pay the minimum 1.0 sats/B fee anyway.  Fee estimates are not needed.
  Also disabled the "Estimated confirmation time:" label from the Transaction
  Dialog winow.  This is not informative either for similar reasons. (cculianu)
* Hardened build system against dependency vulnerabilities (cculianu)
* Fixed bug when Coins -> "Spend" and you right-click in the Send tab's
  coins area. (#1269) (Mark Lundeberg)
* Winows: Added some missing OpenGL libs to the built package.  Qt will now
  use OpenGL or fall back to ANGLE (GL -> D3D translation layer) or software
  rendering. The fallbacks help with buggy drivers. (cculianu, Axel Gembe)
* Fixed Tx Dialog breaking on esoteric scriptsigs (#1263) (Mark Lundeberg)
* Strip whitespace when copying various right-click -> "Copy Amount" to the
  clipboard. (cculianu)

# Release 4.0.3

* Added Schnorr signatures to UI and backend (fyookball, cculianu,
  Mark Lundeberg)
* After much trial and tribulation: fixed broken KeepKey support: KeepKey
  webusb now works, too. Latest devices should work again. Thanks Axel!
  (Axel Gembe)
* Fixed multisig not working on Trezor (& KeepKey) (cculianu, Axel Gembe)
* Updated QR reading accuracy and detection for Linux AppImage & Windows by
  updating the version of ZBar we ship; it's custom-compiled by us from
  official repo to include only what's needed. (Axel Gembe)
* Fix #1349 -- Assertion Error on daemon stop (cculianu)
* Added "Hardware Wallet Support..." tool in menu and in Install Wizard for
  Linux only to install udev rules for HW wallets. (Axel Gembe, cculianu)
* OP_RETURN-too-large message in UI was wrong, off by 1 (Axel Gembe)
* Fix #1338 - Crash on BIP38 private key sweep (cculianu, im_uname)
* AppImage build fixups (Axel Gembe)
* Added/removed some servers from servers.json (cculianu, dagurval, im_uname)
* Address list: remove double space in balance column (Axel Gembe)
* Console: Make insert key toggle overwrite mode (Axel Gembe)
* x509 certs: Print better error messages when certs are expired; affects
  bitpay BIP70 (cculianu, SomberNight)
* Layout and Qt effects fixups for various (Axel Gembe)
* Fix #1306 - Dark theme glitches (Axel Gembe)
* Fixups to keyboard navigation for console tab (Axel Gembe)
* Fix console font being reset when moving between monitors on Windows
  (Axel Gembe)
* Qt accelerator key fixups (Axel Gembe)
* Fix #1261 - Mojave Dark mode looked bad (cculianu)
* Added fancy warning box on top of Console tab to prevent social engineering
  attacks (Axel Gembe)
* Added -R/--relax-warnings CLI option to disable Secp & other warnings
  (Axel Gembe)
* Better Qt error messages when importing bad WIF p2sh 'private keys' (cculianu)
* Ledger Nano-X USB device support (Axel Gembe)
* Various small other nits & bugfixes [see commit log] (cculianu, Axel Gembe)

# Release 4.0.4

* Added a brand new, cross platform and awesome QR Code scanner #1376
  (Axel Gembe, cculianu)
* Fixed QR icon appearing black/invisible on some Linux systems
  (Axel Gembe, cculianu)
* Allow user to load any image containing a QR code in the various QR-scan
  style dialogs: Pay-to in Send tab, Private Key Sweep, etc. (Axel Gembe)
* Fix #1375 - Ensure 'Receive' tab does not ever give you a frozen address.
  (cculianu)
* Schnorr signing has been enabled by default if previously unspecified if the
  libsecp256k1[ABC] is present (non-HW, non-multisig wallets only) (cculianu)
* Fix #1385 - Auto-switch send tab mode Shuffled/Unshuffled depending on the
  selected coins when doing Coins -> right click -> Spend. (cculianu)
* Various bugfixes (Axel Gembe, cculianu)

# Release 4.0.5

* Bugfix -- Imported Private Key wallets as well as some HW wallets (keepkey)
  could not sign or save a tx in 4.0.4 due to a subtle bug introduced as part
  of a refactor. Fixed. (cculianu)
* Fixed QR scanner looking off-center on some platforms. (Axel Gembe)
* Fixed QR scanner quirks on some platforms when failure to configure camera
  resolution confused the QR scanner a little bit. (Axel Gembe)

# Release 4.0.6

* Added CoinText support. Just enter 'cointext:ANY_PHONE_NUMBER' in the send tab
  to use it! (cculianu, Jonald Fyookball)
* Added a brand-new Transaction Dialog feature "Download input data" which
  allows you to get 100% accurate fees, input addresses, and input amounts for
  ANY tx in your wallet or even NOT in your wallet. (cculianu)
* Various fixups to script parser code and misc. transaction refactorings
  (Mark Lundeberg)
* Qt: Enable automatic high DPI scaling on Windows and Linux (Axel Gembe)
* Redid some of the icons and graphics to support high DPI (Axel Gembe,
  cculianu)
* Added command-line option `--qt_disable_highdpi` to force-disable high DPI
  mode (Axel Gembe)
* Bugfixes to Ledger support + allow up to 187 byte OP_RETURN (Axel Gembe)
* Misc tiny UI nits and other fixups (cculianu, Axel Gembe)
* Updated libsecp256k1 to latest from Bitcoin-ABC (cculianu)
* Reduced .dmg, .exe, & .AppImage binary sizes by optimizing images (Axel Gembe)
* Updated servers.json (imaginaryusername)
* CashShuffle: Raised default shuffle limit to 99.9999 BCH (cculianu)
* Replaced the 'clock' icons with new hi-res versions. Please direct all
  hatemail to Calin Culianu for he volunteers to take full responsibility.
  (Jason Pribble, cculianu, James Cramer, Axel Gembe)
* Minor fix: Clicking a link in browser to open a URL in Electron Cash no longer
  resurrects a closed wallet and instead opens the link in whatever active
  wallet windows exist. (cculianu)

# Release 4.0.7

* CoinText: Show a popup label after CoinText is initiated to remind user
  they need to hit "Send" or "Preview" to proceed (cculianu, imaginary_username)
* Tx Dialog: Fixups and functionality expanded. All wallet addresses are now
  links which are clickable (leading to the address's history view). All input
  prevouts are now clickable links as well; they lead to a tx dialog screen for
  the prevout tx. Additionally, we added a right-click context menu for the
  input/output panes of the tx dialog window. This brings EC's functionality
  closer to that of a mini block explorer. (cculianu)
* KeepKey: Fixed a packaging issue where loading BIP39 onto an uninitialized
  KeepKey would fail with a Python exception on Windows & Mac #1434 (cculianu)
* Python 3.6 is officially the minimum Python version for Electron Cash now.
  In the last version, you could still run on Python 3.5 (poorly), we just
  made it official. (Axel Gembe, cculianu)
* Added OP_RETURN capability to the 'Receive' tab. You can now generate receive
  request URIs and QR codes containing 'op_return' and/or 'op_return_raw'. Not
  all wallets can read this query string argument, but Electron Cash can.
  (cculianu)
* Linux run-from-source: Warn/Abort with helpful messages if user is missing
  required PyQt libs such as QtSvg. (cculianu)
* QR Scanner: Added informative message for Linux run-from-source users who
  happen to have a broken PyQt5 lacking a required lib for accessing the
  camera. (cculianu)
* Schnorr: Defaults to off for watching-only wallets. This is to prevent
  air-gapped setups from underestimating fee between generating and signing EC.
  (cculianu)
* Tx Dialog: Warn if user is attempting to broadcat a low fee tx of <1 sats/B.
  (cculianu)
* Address tab: Allow CTRL+F of addresses prefixed with bitcoincash: to do the
  expected thing. (cculianu)
* Various bugfixes (cculianu)
* OpenAlias: Fix #1441 - Resurrected it form the dead. It wasn't working before.
  You can now send payments to people via their openalias eg user@domain.net
  (requires they set up a DNS TXT record).  See https://openalias.org/#implement
  (Axel Gembe)
* AppImage: 100% deterministic builds now. (Axel Gembe)
* AppImage: "Open in block explorer" now works (Axel Gembe)
* Windows: We figured out what was causing the anti-virus false positives on
  our recent releases and took steps to reduce the possibility of AV false
  positives going forward. (cculianu, Axel Gembe)
* CashShuffle: Fix #1223 - Finally resolved the "dead menu actions" bug where
  sometimes after bringing up the CashShuffle settings, hotkeys and File->menu
  actions would no longer respond. (cculianu, Axel Gembe)
* Quotes/Fiat Exchange Rate: The "historical rates" code was buggy and prone
  to "no data" being shown even when the server we get the quotes from has
  data. Bug #1448. This has now been fully fixed and made unbuggy. (cculianu)
* Export Wallet History: Fix #1459 - The Wallet -> Export History facility now
  always exports fiat history data if "Fiat History" is enabled in preferences.
  Note also that the history export is now sorted in descending order by date,
  like the history tab default sort order.  (cculianu)
* Update checker: Made the "new version available!" notification less obtrusive:
  it now posts a message to the system tray popup as well as just creating a
  new status bar icon you can click on to respond to the notification at your
  leisure.  Hopefully this will tempt fewer people to turn off the notifications
  (cculianu)
* Preferences pane: Split up the "Transactions" tab in the preferences to
  "per-wallet" and "app-global" sections to more clearly communicate in the UI
  which of the options are global and which are per-wallet. Closes issue #1427
  (cculianu)
* Preferences pane: Added a new option "notify when receiving funds" which
  is on by default and if unchecked, allows you to no longer receive system
  tray notifications on tx's. This is a per-wallet setting. Closes issue #1451
  (cculianu)
* Tx Send Confirmation: Added a new button to the tx send confirmation dialog
  "Copy link" which copies the link to the tx on the configured block explorer.
  Issue #1464 (cculianu)
* AppImage builds have been made SIGNIFICANTLY smaller. Here's to faster
  downloads and peppier startup times, hooray! In addition, the macOS .dmg build
  and the Windows .exe builds have been made slightly smaller. (Axel Gembe)
* Cash Address Toggle: Replaced icon with a much nicer one. (Leandro Di Marco)
* Cash Address Toggle: After a reddit poll was conducted, we decided to make it
  possible to disable the cash address status bar button in the GUI. It's on
  by default, but can be disabled in Preferences -> General. In addition, the
  Preferences -> General tab has been laid out slightly differently. (cculianu)
* Improved system tray icon and other assorted icons for high DPI. (Axel Gembe)
* Various build system fixes and bugs fixed. (Axel Gembe)

# Release 4.0.8

* Cash Accounts support has been added to Electron Cash!  Most of the UI for it
  is in the "Contacts" tab (View -> Show Contacts), there are also UI bits to it
  in the Addresses tab, in the Tools menu, and of course, the Send tab (where
  you can enter any Cash Account and it will get auto-resolved for you!)
  #1505 (cculianu with massive platform work from Axel Gembe)
* Fixups to allow Digital Bitbox and Ledger to sign more types of OP_RETURN
  outputs. (imaginaryusername, Axel Gembe, cculianu)
* "Button" Editor: Fix keypress events going to the editor when the buttons are
  focused and other nits. #1518 (Axel Gembe)
* More help for "QtSvg Missing" error; #1516 (Mark Lundeberg)
* Qt: Performance fix to History tab for wallets with many txs when verifying.
  The performance when verifying for wallets with a huge history was not optimal
  and the UI would periodically hang. This has been fixed. (cculianu)
* SPV: Make the merkle node checker no longer care whether "inner node looks
  like a tx" because this check is no longer need after the Nov. 2018 hard-fork.
  (cculianu, Mark Lundeberg)
* Fix #1502 - Intermittent iOS Crash Reporter on bad/expired BIP70 Payment
  (cculianu)
* Translations: Add support for plural forms #1500 (Axel Gembe)
* Coins Tab: Added default sort order of Amount, Descending. The Coins tab now
  also remebers whatever sort order you gave it. This should be good for
  CashShuffle users with many coins in their coins tab. (cculianu)
* Wallet: Improve performance of is_mine() check from O(N) to O(logN) (cculianu)
* Qt Network Dialog: Let the user edit the host/port in peace (SomberNight,
  cculianu)
* Fonts: Improve color emoji support on Windows and Linux #1498 (Axel Gembe)
* Fonts: Add Google Noto Color Emoji font subset #1496, #1523 - This is bundled
  in Windows and AppImage and loaded at runtime if the user lacks a suitable
  color emoji font (Axel Gembe).
* AppImage: Bundle more binaries to increase compatibility & other fixes #1492
  (Axel Gembe)
* Updated "Error, Could not import PyQt5" message to be more helpful (cculianu)
* Qt: Update to 5.12.3 for Windows and AppImage builds #1490 (Axel Gembe)
* Linux Qt: Warn user if running Qt < 5.12 (this has terrible font support
  which causes EC to render fonts badly if using emojis or unicode) (cculianu)
* AppImage: Upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 as base #1489 (Axel Gembe)
* Build: Protect against PGP keyserver poisoning attack #1487 (Axel Gembe)
* Added electroncash.se server to servers.json (Georg Engelman)
* TxDialog: Allow various fields to be selected by mouse. (cculianu)
* TxDialog: Added the "Mined in block" field to the dialog. (cculianu)
* Localization: The app now defaults to the system language on Windows, Mac and
  generic Unix for new installs.  The preferences dialog has also been improved
  to bring the General tab to the front and make the language picker contain
  translated language names. #1477 (Axel Gembe, cculianu, Alexander Schlarb)
* Fix #1473: Omit bitcoincash: prefix from legacy address in receive tab QR
  image if no parameters are filled-in other than 'address'. This allows users
  to quickly use the receive tab to scan a QR image from a mobile wallet that
  doesn't know about bitcoincash:. Note that if the receive tab has parameters
  filled in eg: description, amount, etc, then the receive request becomes a
  URI and it will have the bitcoincash: prefix prepended, even if using legacy
  address mode. (cculianu)
* Ledger: Fix #1479: 2FA Dialog with Legacy devices and multiple outputs was
  crashy due to a small programming error. Fixed. (Axel Gembe)
* Added various hotkeys to the GUI Ctrl+K, Ctrl+M, etc. You will see them in
  the various in-app menus (such as Tools, Wallet, etc). (cculianu)
* Made the network layer more resilient to malformed server responses.
  (cculianu)
* Search box has been fixed to not get crushed by the balance label and to also
  work better and have placeholder text. Closes #1493 (cculianu)
* Coins tab: Offer alternate address format copy (eg "Copy Legacy Address" if
  in CashAddr mode, and vice versa). This was already available in the Addresses
  tab but wasn't in the Coins tab. Closes #1476 (cculianu)
* Address tab: Allow multi-select and copy of data items such as Addresses,
  Address & Balance, etc. Closes #1475 (cculianu)
* Contacts tab: All contacts can now also get an optional label. The label is
  keyed off the address and is saved in wallet.labels. Closes #1508 (cculianu)
* Added better help for the Pay to edit in the send tab. The help text has been
  improved to clarify this advanced widget's capabilities, and a '?' help button
  has been added in the tool buttons for the line edit. (cculianu)
* App icon has been updated to be a little more rectangular and render better
  across resolutions and platforms. #1526 (cculianu, Axel Gembe, fyoookball,
  BeltranLeo)
* Update checker: Use a longer timeout to not time out when using a proxy
  server. #1509 (cculianu)
* External Plugins: Be more resilient to a bad plugin file. #1533 (cculianu)
* Updated translations (Axel Gembe)
* Email plugin crash fix #1534 (cculianu)
* Minor UI bugfixes. (Axel Gembe, cculianu)

  distributions. (Axel Gembe)
* Added preferences options for "Use FreeType" (Windows) and "fontconfig
  overrides" (Linux).  (cculianu)
* Updated blockchain checkpoint to block 592911. (Malcolm Smith)
* Added support for "cashacct:" URIs #1547. You can paste these in the Pay-to
  edit in the Send tab or, if on Linux, Mac & Windows, click on a cashacct:
  link in your browser as well. (cculianu)
* Fixed esoteric crash bug which would occur sometimes when opening the
  preferences dialog. This bug was due to bugs in PyQt5 when using QtMultimedia
  and the fix involved loading QtMultimedia at app start, rather than on-demand.
  #1545 (cculianu)
* Fix #1552: Disallow "Request payment" in addresses tab when address is used.
  This would lead to an inconsistent UI; the receive tab would always enforce a
  new address anyway, so the option in the right-click menu was misleading at
  best in that situation.  "Request payment" works as normal if the address is
  unused, however. (cculianu)
* Fixed Windows setup.exe to be more reproducible and other misc build fixes.
  (Axel Gembe, cculianu)
* Fixed very rare uncaught exception due to misbehaving plugin #1554. (cculianu)
* KeepKey & Trezor: Fix WebUSB on Windows 10 1903 by patching libusb, #1556.
  (Axel Gembe)
* Cash Accounts: Lookup/Search results offer a "Details..." link now instead
  of the "View tx..." link. You can view tx on the details page. (cculianu)
* Qt: Added proper keyboard navigation to the Transaction Dialog window, and
  various other places. #1557 (Axel Gembe)
* Android: Added native libsecp256k1 support (Malcolm Smith)
* Bugfix #1240, #892, #1484: Prevent infinite startup hangs due to lockfile
  timestamp in the future. (cculianu)
* Email Plugin: Minor fixups and fixed bug #924. (cculianu)
* iOS: Fix #1273 -- Crash due to trying to pass a Python Exception to obj-c as
  string. (cculianu)
* Various build and packaging fixes for Windows. (Axel Gembe)
* Added BitPay 2.0 JSON API support. (cculianu)
* Fixup to some plugins such as Scheduled Payments and Inter-Wallet-Transfer
  raising uncaught exceptions if they are loaded and enabled and user hits
  Ctrl+F (cculianu).
* LabelSync: Prevent error dialog spam when labels plugin fails to update
  labels on the server. (cculianu)

# Release 4.0.10

* Lib & Qt: Added Bip38Key encryption support to both the library for plugins
  to use as well as to the Qt UI for users to be able to export or encrypt WIF
  keys as BIP38 encrypted keys; #1593, #1594. (cculianu)
* Minor internal i18n nits, #1571. (Mark Lundeberg)
* Windows: Switch LibUSB to version 1.0.23-rc2, #1572. (Axel Gembe)
* iOS: Added native secp256k1 to iOS build, drastically improving signing speed.
  (cculianu)
* iOS: Added Schnorr signatures. (cculianu)

* Qt: Made generated QR codes look better on HighDPI displays. (cculianu,
  zebra-lucky)
* Misc. localization and internationalization fixups. (Axel Gembe)
* OSX: Minor fixup for Mojave font weights being rendered too thick. (cculianu)
* Minor bugfix: Guard against "all zero" transactions coming from malicious
  servers, #987. (cculianu)
* Qt Console: Fixed the warning box layout to fit on-screen in all setups,
  #1584. (Axel Gembe)
* Qt: Fixed minor warning about alpha value, #1585. (proteanx)
* OSX & Linux AppImage: Bumped bundled Python version to 3.6.9. (cculianu)
* iOS: Added a ruby helper script which, if running Brew, will auto-set-up
  more of the Xcode project for the user after creating it with
  `make_ios_project.sh`. (jonspock)
* Added SLP awareness to all wallets. Even though one can't easily get an SLP
  token into a non-SLP wallet, it is still possible. The EC internals now
  track transactions containing SLP tokens and guard against spending such
  coins. Coins that have SLP tokens on them are highlighted in green in the
  "Coins" tab and cannot be spent from the UI.  This is to prevent token
  burn, #1602 (cculianu)
* Android build fixes, #1599. (mhsmith)
* More Android fixes: Added stability improvements and various corner
  case bugfixes (see github PR #1605 for details). (mhsmith)
* Fiat FX Rate: Bitpay.com URL / API endpoint has changed, thus breaking fiat
  exchange rate sources if "Bitpay" was selected. Fixed. (cculianu)
* Updated websockets (electrum-merchant): fixed stale/old code which no longer
  ran, added '--payment_url' option, and other miscellany. (cculianu)
* Implemented BIP70 properly on Qt and iOS; #1612. (cculianu)
* MacOS HW Wallets: Fixed SIGSEGV crash due to talking to the device from
  multiple threads which is not supported on Darwin. (cculianu)
* Ledger Nano HW support has been vastly improved: It should be less crashy
  and provide the user with much more meaningful messages for getting the device
  into the proper state to talk to Electron Cash. (cculianu)
* Wallet: Fixed erroneous coinbase maturity logic. Immature mined coins were
  erroneously being withheld from spending for an extra confirmation. (cculianu)
* Coins tab: Coinbase coins that are not mature are now highlighted in blue
  text and are not allowed to be selected for individual coin spending
  (previously you could select them for spending with no way to actually spend
  them which was bad UX). (cculianu)
* TxDialog: coinbase tx's now show 0 fee, rather than 'unknown' (cculianu)

# Release 4.0.11

* Added SatoChip hardware wallet support: https://satochip.io/.
  #1668 (Baudoin Collard, cculianu)
* Added API support for plugins to register themselves with the command-line
  in order to offer RPC service commands. #1670 (Mark Lundeberg)
* Added "Show crash reporter" to preferences, and re-laid-out the preferences
  pane. #1673 (cculianu)
* Fix #1671 -- "No data" for fiat when using the 'history' RPC command has been
  now fixed. (cculianu)
* Fix #1679 -- Exporting history now shows fees (if known), as well as input
  and output addresses involved in a tx. (cculianu)
* Plugin API fix for @hook. #1669 (cculianu, Mark Lundeberg)
* Internal API optimization for transaction signing #1666 (Mark Lundeberg)
* Added BlockExplorer.one for both testnet and mainnet as a block explorer
  configurable in preferences. #1664 (Axel Gembe)
* CLI: Added --op_return and --op_return_raw options for the 'payto' command.
  (cculianu)
* AppImage: Improved binary stripping for more reproducible builds. #1662
  (Axel Gembe)
* Updated SSL certificates to Sept. 2019. This should hopefully fix some of the
  "Unable to verify SSL" errors some users have seen when using CashShuffle.
  (cculianu)
* Fixed a long-standing bug where sometimes Electron Cash would hang forever on
  startup due to a stale/old daemon 'lockfile'. (cculianu)
* Qt history tab: Added workaround for persitent 'Unknown' balances when using
  advanced scripts to spend funds. (cculianu)
* Qt UI: Add mechanism to prohibit '3..' p2sh by default, which should protect
  users from accidentally sending BCH to BTC segwit addresses. This protection
  can be disabled in preferences. Issues #1658 and #1225. (cculianu)
* Updated README for better instructions on how to run the development/git
  version. (Mark Lundeberg)
* Added servers to servers.json: tbch.loping.net, greedyhog.ddns.net. Removed
  server theblains.org. (Axel Gembe, greedyhog)
* iOS: Fixes for iOS 13.0+ and other miscellany (cculianu)
* iOS fix: "Downloading headers xx%..." is now more accurate (cculianu)
* iOS fix for bug #1651, crash if prefs screen up when wallet closed. (cculianu)
* transaction.py: don't append value when serializing inputs with scriptSig.
  #1648, #1628, #1637 (Mark Lundeberg)
* Addresses tab: hide all empty change addresses, not just used ones &
  pop open change list by default. #1646 (Mark Lundeberg)
* Android: allow specifying a server which isn't in servers.json. #1644 #1636
  (Malcolm Smith)
* Add Swahili to the language list. (Patrick Kariuki)
* Bumped Qt version to 5.13.2 on most platforms. (cculianu)
* Qt prefs: Renamed the default "light" UI style to "Default". On some systems
  this style is actually dark in appearance. (cculianu)
* cashaccts: Fixed parse bug in parsing eg 'cashacctname#123,1.23'. (cculianu)
* Misc. menu and dialog nits, polish, cleanups, more consistent Capitalization,
  & More. (Tom Zander, cculianu)
* Qt: main window, make sure Ctrl+Q is shown in File->Quit. (cculianu)
* Transations: prefer verbatim scriptSig for (re)serializing complete
  transaction inputs. #1637 (Mark Lundeberg)
* Added index_url override to addrequest command. #1636 (Yuki Matsumoto)
* i18n: Use pgettext in a few places, and various fixups. #1624 (Axel Gembe)
* Very many Android fixes. #1614 (Malcolm Smith)
* p2sh: Fix coin tracking / balance, etc for esoteric scriptSigs/redeemScripts
  in inputs. This should make it easier to have a wallet that tracks smart
  contract addresses and other advanced usages of Bitcoin. #1620 (cculianu)
* synchronizer: Check txid from server against response content. This is a
  paranoia check to make sure the server isn't being malicious. (cculianu)
* i18n nit: Translate 'Unknown' string in format_satoshis. (cculianu)
* Removed cashshuffle.net #1619 (Georg Engelmann)
* Configure payment_url to include payment request ID. #1617 (Mark Meson)
* Command-line: added `addressconvert` command. (cculianu)
* BIP70 Payment Request Fix. There were potentially subtle bugs in how we
  handled BIP70. Nothing major. They have been fixed. #1615 (cculianu & Mark
  Meson)
* iOS: Add SLP-awareness & protection to the UI. (cculianu)
* Misc. refactoring, nits, and bugfixes (cculianu, Mark Lundeberg)

# Release 4.0.12

* **TRANSLATIONS!** This release includes a complete coverage of the Spanish
  language as well as many other language strings added for German, Portuguese,
  and other languages. (various contributors, w/ Jonald Fyookball as organizer)
* Made export history way better (#1682) -- Exporting history from the GUI or
  the CLI can now optionally include accurate fee data as well as accurate fiat
  amounts (if fiat history is enabled in the GUI). (cculianu)
* Fix #1681 - Gave cashshuffle message.proto file a package name. This caused
  issues for some source users whereby the lack of a package name may clash with
  modules installed on the user's system. (cculianu)
* Android (phase 4): Add ability to delete closed wallets (#1690) (Andrew#128)
* More graceful and softer shutdown on Ctrl-C / SIGINT (#1695) (Mark Lundeberg)

  crashes. (cculianu)

# Release 4.0.13

- **BIP 39 Seed format** is now the ***native seed format*** for Electron Cash!
  (Calin Culianu)
    - New wallets will always generate seeds in this format. When restoring from
      seed, format auto-detection is implemented (so that old 'Electrum' style
      seeds continue to work).
    - Additionally, wallets created/restored from BIP39 will no longer have no
      "Seed" icon in the GUI (and you can always view their seed; it is never
      "forgotten").
  - The seed dialog now always shows derivation paths for BIP39 seeds.
- **New integrated Tor capability**. (Axel Gembe, Calin Culianu)
    - This capability will be bundled with Electron Cash for the upcoming
      ***CashFusion*** feature.
    - For now, though -- you can use it to start/stop Tor right from inside
      Electron Cash -- **no additional Tor browser install needed**!

  (Calin Culianu)
- About dialog: Update copyright year to 2020 and make localizable. (Axel Gembe)
