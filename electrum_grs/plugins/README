Plugin rules:

 * The plugin system of Electrum-GRS is designed to allow the development
   of new features without increasing the core code of Electrum-GRS.

 * Electrum-GRS is written in pure python. if you want to add a feature
   that requires non-python libraries, then it must be submitted as a
   plugin. If the feature you want to add requires communication with
   a remote server (not an Electrum-GRS server), then it should be a
   plugin as well. If the feature you want to add introduces new
   dependencies in the code, then it should probably be a plugin.

 * We expect plugin developers to maintain their plugin code. However,
   once a plugin is merged in Electrum-GRS, we will have to maintain it
   too, because changes in the Electrum-GRS code often require updates in
   the plugin code. Therefore, plugins have to be easy to maintain. If
   we believe that a plugin will create too much maintenance work in
   the future, it will be rejected.

 * Plugins should be compatible with Electrum-GRS' conventions. If your
   plugin does not fit with Electrum-GRS' architecture, or if we believe
   that it will create too much maintenance work, it will not be
   accepted. In particular, do not duplicate existing Electrum-GRS code in
   your plugin.

 * We may decide to remove a plugin after it has been merged in
   Electrum-GRS. For this reason, a plugin must be easily removable,
   without putting at risk the user's groestlcoins. If we feel that a
   plugin cannot be removed without threatening users who rely on it,
   we will not merge it.
