# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report security issues send an email to electrumsysdev@gmail.com.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name | Fingerprint |
|------|-------------|
| ThomasV | 6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6 |
| SomberNight | 4AD6 4339 DFA0 5E20 B3F6 AD51 E7B7 48CD AF5E 5ED9 |

You can import a key by running the following command with that
individual’s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"`
Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints containing spaces.

These public keys can also be found in the ElectrumSys git repository,
in the top-level `pubkeys` folder.
