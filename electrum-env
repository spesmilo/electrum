# This script creates a virtualenv named 'env' and installs all
# python dependencies before activating the env and running Electrum.
# If 'env' already exists, it is activated and Electrum is started
# without any installations. Additionally, the PYTHONPATH environment
# variable is set so that system packages such as e.g. apt installed
# PyQt will also be visible.
#
# By default, only pure python dependencies are installed.
# If you would like more extras to be installed, do e.g.:
# $ source ./env/bin/activate
# $ pip install -e '.[crypto,gui,hardware]'
# $ deactivate

set -e
